- Relevant quantities: same as report + pictures for visualization + maybe give equations
- Numerical methods: same as report, mention: use own solvers
- collision model: 
	- composite objects consisting of tetrahedra: easy to use, easy to compute
	- usage of bounding boxes:
		- simple bounding boxes
		- sorted bounding boxes
		- octtree
	- mention: almost everything self-written
- architecture
	- model-view-controller	
	- use entity-component-system framework
	- implemented own components, own systems
	- show usual chain of execution: collision detection, compute & apply forces, update velocity, update position (rounding happens here!)
- known problems
	- tunneling
	- ball remains within obstacle
	- limiting roundoff error
