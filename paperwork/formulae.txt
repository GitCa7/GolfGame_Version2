FORMULAE
movement for velocity v and position vector s
s(n+1) = s(n) + v*t
change to: solver for DE v = ds / dt

acceleration a
v(n+1) = v(n) + a*t
change to: solver for DE a = dv/dt

force F
a = F / m
assuming F, m are constant and F is exerted only once, we don't need a DE here

collision on a plane with normalized normal n_u
decompose v into vector u orthogonal to the plane and w parallel to the plane
u = v * n_u * n_u
w = v - u
compute the outgoing velocity v', considering the coefficient of restitution c_r
and the coefficient of friction c_f
v' = w*c_f - u*c_r
computing the force F_c needed to transform v into v'
F_c = m * dv/dt = m * (v' - v)/dt

computing the normal force F_n, being the projection of F_g onto the normalized normal vector n_u of
the plane supporting an object
F_n = F_g * n_u * n_u
